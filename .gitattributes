# Suppress noisy generated files in diffs.

# Dart files generated from the files next to them:
*.g.dart -diff

# Generated files for testing migrations:
test/model/schemas/*.dart -diff
test/model/schemas/*.json -diff

# On the other hand, keep diffs for pubspec.lock.  It contains
# information independent of any non-generated file in the tree.
# And thankfully it's much less verbose than, say, a yarn.lock.
#pubspec.lock -diff
